### About me 😄
I may consider myself a software engineer (or a mage), but in reality I am just a guy who loves technology and how it can transform people's lives. I love projects with direct impact and with a high "mass transformational potential", that's why I hardly deny an opportunity for learning, not only with development, but also in other activities, such as design, product and digital business.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a tattoo with source code:
```c
#include <technology>
#include <blockchain>

bool main() {
  bool success;
  
  while(!success) {
    code();
    workHard();
    beNice();
    success = improve(this);
  }
  
  return success;
}
```
> before you try to fix my source code, understand it as poetry. OK!?
